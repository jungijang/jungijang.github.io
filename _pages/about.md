I am a Ph.D. student majoring in Computer Science Engineering at Seoul National University. My research interests include tensor mining and time series analysis. I am currently advised by [Prof. U Kang](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/~ukang/). I received B.S. in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at Seoul National University.
